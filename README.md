Advanced CSS Challenge: Portfolio Project

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a portfolio that effectively demonstrates a developer's web development skills and showcases several deployed web applications. In addition, the portfolio project demonstrates the following skills:
 * flexbox
 * media queries
 * CSS variables

In order to meet requirements, the loaded portfolio should contain the following items and capabilities:
 * the developer's name
 * a recent photo or avatar of the developer
 * links to "About Me", "Work" and "Contact" sections
 * clicking on a link in the navigation bars causes the UI to scroll to the corresponding section
 * scrolling to the "Work" section leads to titled images of the developer's applications
 * the first application's image is larger in size than the other application's images
 * clicking on any application's image takes the user to that deployed application
